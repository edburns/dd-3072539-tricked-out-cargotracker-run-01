# Campaign Evidence Matrix

Campaign: `1-trick-out-01-remove-before-merge`

This document records what the campaign actually demonstrates about the ten
boring reasons from the talk abstract. It begins with hypotheses and
`Not exercised` classifications. Implementation issues must replace those
initial values only when durable campaign evidence exists.

The ignorance-reduction plan and generated implementation issues define the
mandatory update timing and completion gates. In particular, the current
issue's evidence must be recorded and merged before the next serial issue
begins.

## Field definitions

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Reason | The ordered reason from the abstract |
| Agentic failure mode | The weakness it is meant to constrain |
| Repository mechanism | Compiler, Maven, test, analyzer, workflow, telemetry, or deployment control |
| Implementation task | The trick-out issue and PR that introduce, exercise, or verify it |
| Observed campaign event | A concrete success, failure, correction, or non-event |
| Artifact | CI run, log, PR, review, trace, JFR, screenshot, or post-mortem |
| Confidence | `Strong`, `Moderate`, `Weak`, `Unsupported`, or `Not exercised` |
| Slide implication | `Main slide`, `Brief mention`, `Appendix`, `Cut`, or `TBD` |

## Update rules

1. Preserve the reason numbering and ordering.
2. Treat the failure modes and mechanisms below as initial hypotheses, not
   evidence.
3. Update every applicable summary row after implementation, validation, and
   review-feedback resolution for an issue.
4. Identify implementation work with exact issue and PR numbers.
5. Link or name durable artifacts precisely: commit SHA, GitHub Actions run and
   job, check name, repository-relative artifact path, log, trace, profile,
   screenshot, or post-mortem section.
6. Distinguish a mechanism being installed from being executed, detecting a
   problem, preventing a problem, or materially improving the work.
7. Record silent or negative results. If the work did not exercise a reason,
   leave or set its confidence to `Not exercised` and explain the non-event.
8. Do not invent evidence or upgrade confidence because a tool merely passed.
9. Do not delete earlier evidence. Update the summary and append a dated
   issue-specific entry to the evidence log.
10. Put reusable implementation guidance in `campaign-lessons.md`, not here.

## Summary matrix

| Reason | Agentic failure mode | Repository mechanism | Implementation task | Observed campaign event | Artifact | Confidence | Slide implication |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Type system | Hallucinated APIs, incompatible values, invalid generics, and domain or layer leakage | Java compiler and Maven compiler configuration | Issue #4 / PR #12; Issue #5 / PR #13; Issue #1 / PR #7 | Issue #5 compiled 95 main and 11 test sources with `-Xlint:all -Werror`; a controlled nonexistent-method fixture failed with javac's `cannot find symbol` diagnostic. Issue #1 compiled and passed both local Maven tiers on JDK 17. Hosted `source-gates` also passed on the tested SHA. | Issue #1 implementation commit `00987d567bb2797524355f234535296ee2fae01b`; local logs `/tmp/20261002-0348-booking-service-test-logs.txt` and `/tmp/20261002-0350-openliberty-package-logs.txt`; previous tested SHA `b19c8c9f2a67822ff5c3abc4a7de888dee353e79`; successful Main Build [run #36804048610](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610), `source-gates` job/check [110185685393](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/job/110185685393); `source-gates` artifact [11136618790](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/artifacts/11136618790), digest `sha256:fdfd048be3d64bde3462a70ab6a289cb4abf49f8ada206abae821265e636942e`; supporting files `compiler.log`, `test-compiler.log`, and `compiler-negative.log` | Strong hosted and local implementation evidence | Brief mention |
| 2. Testing ecosystem | Behavior that compiles but is incomplete, incorrect, or regressive | JUnit, Arquillian, Open Liberty integration tests, architecture tests, and acceptance checks | Issue #2 / PR #9; Issue #6 / PR #14; fixture baseline repair; Issue #1 / PR #7 | The safety-net implementation adds a reproducible inventory (8 active test classes, 3 dormant, 0 removed), two facade/DTO boundary tests, and a compiled-dependency DDD layer baseline. On the exact primary merge SHA, the canonical unit tier passed 27/27 with zero skipped tests, the managed Open Liberty tier passed 4/4 with zero skipped tests, all negative controls passed, and the production-WAR acceptance lifecycle passed root, Administration dashboard, seeded detail, and REST JSON contracts while proving cleanup. The later fixture baseline repair replaced the brittle exact-four-test assertion with a named-method and zero-failure contract that still passes the feature-free four-test suite and permits a valid fifth test. Issue #1's targeted Open Liberty tier passed all 5 ordered tests with zero failures, errors, or skips; the package tier passed all 32 tests with zero failures, errors, or skips. | Issue #1 commit `00987d567bb2797524355f234535296ee2fae01b`; targeted log `/tmp/20261002-0348-booking-service-test-logs.txt`; package log `/tmp/20261002-0350-openliberty-package-logs.txt`; generated report `demo/target/surefire-reports/org.eclipse.cargotracker.application.BookingServiceTest.txt`; previous primary merge SHA `0858b99c14e6d47649008716116504dcdab3bced`, successful Main Build [run #36818583169](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36818583169), `formatting` job/check [110228986496](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36818583169/job/110228986496), `source-gates` job/check [110229082017](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36818583169/job/110229082017), and `build` job/check [110229409615](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36818583169/job/110229409615); fixture baseline repair SHA `94950cfceefc85edaec68eb6b61a16e0e6779ecc`, successful Main Build [run #36956818505](https://github.com/azure-javaee/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36956818505), `formatting` job/check [110681507992](https://github.com/azure-javaee/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36956818505/job/110681507992), `source-gates` job/check [110681594814](https://github.com/azure-javaee/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36956818505/job/110681594814), `build` job/check [110681940309](https://github.com/azure-javaee/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36956818505/job/110681940309), and `test-reports-liberty` artifact [11206483198](https://github.com/azure-javaee/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36956818505/artifacts/11206483198), digest `sha256:19b0c9c08136763bbb8f947581e35680c6770717d0a82cf7a89311578ea4af53` | Strong previous hosted evidence plus Issue #1 local integration/package evidence; Issue #1 hosted check is pending. | Brief mention |

## Issue-specific evidence log

Append one subsection for every implementation issue, even when it produces no
meaningful evidence. Keep entries in serial issue order.

### Issue #1: Add the application-layer deadline change operation

- **PR:** #7 (repository issue #2)
- **Implementation commit:** `00987d567bb2797524355f234535296ee2fae01b`
- **Completed:** 2026-10-02 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 1, 2
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 1, 2
- **Implementation result:** Added `BookingService.changeDeadline(TrackingId, Date)`. `DefaultBookingService` loads the cargo, reconstructs its route specification with its current origin and destination plus the requested deadline, applies it through `Cargo.specifyNewRoute(...)`, stores the aggregate, and logs the tracking ID and deadline. The ordered integration test verifies the changed deadline, unchanged itinerary and delivery fields, and recalculated `MISROUTED` status.
- **Observed events:**
  - The required runner paths `/usr/lib/jvm/msopenjdk-17-amd64/` and `/usr/share/maven` were absent. Both Maven commands ran with the installed Temurin JDK 17 at `/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk-amd64/`, Maven at `/usr/share/apache-maven-3.9.16`, and Ant at `/usr/share/ant`.
  - `cd demo && ./mvnw -Popenliberty -Dtest=BookingServiceTest clean test` passed: 5 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped; `BUILD SUCCESS`.
  - `cd demo && ./mvnw clean package -Popenliberty` passed: 32 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped; `BUILD SUCCESS`.
  - Both commands used the required tee-to-log discipline. Logs: `/tmp/20261002-0348-booking-service-test-logs.txt` and `/tmp/20261002-0350-openliberty-package-logs.txt`.
  - No workflow or web, facade, REST, Liberty, or persistence-configuration files changed.
  - Hosted status was not yet available for this implementation commit: the PR status returned `pending` with zero statuses; the initial Main Build run [#36961553344](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3072539-tricked-out-cargotracker-run-01/actions/runs/36961553344) completed `action_required` with zero jobs and no failed-job logs. Do not treat this as a passing CI gate.
- **Durable artifacts:**
  - Implementation commit `00987d567bb2797524355f234535296ee2fae01b`; local Maven logs above; generated Surefire report `demo/target/surefire-reports/org.eclipse.cargotracker.application.BookingServiceTest.txt`.
  - GitHub PR #7 status for commit `00987d567bb2797524355f234535296ee2fae01b` was pending with no reported status checks at evidence-update time.
- **Evidence assessment:** Strong local evidence for Java compilation, aggregate mutation, persistence, and all requested delivery assertions; hosted extensible integration-test CI remains unverified.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** The named-method extensible integration-test gate accepts the fifth ordered `BookingServiceTest` when the new behavior is exercised through the aggregate.

### Issue #2: Establish the Open Liberty-only baseline

- **PR:** #9
- **Implementation commit:** `bc6c3e387ccf5b3cab5e14b5ab4d91d512ef426b` (pre-merge; do not treat as a future merge commit)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-30 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 2, 3, 5, 6
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 2, 3, 5, 6
- **Implementation result:** Removed Payara/Cargo/GlassFish runtime paths and guidance; retained Open Liberty as the sole active-by-default profile to preserve the resolved Maven validation tiers. Preserved Java 17, Java EE 7, `javax.*`, WAR packaging, and `cargo-tracker.war`.
- **Observed events:**
  - Spotless passed; the clean package passed all 28 tests (including four managed Open Liberty tests).
  - The production-WAR lifecycle deployed the WAR, started Liberty with the 90-second bound, observed server/application readiness, and received HTTP 200 `application/json` containing seeded `ABC123`; the EXIT cleanup invoked `liberty:stop` successfully.
  - The canonical profile-excluded compile and 24-test unit tiers passed; the explicit Liberty integration tier passed four tests; canonical package produced the WAR without a Liberty runtime directory.
  - A temporary unsupported-server fixture was found by the same search that returned no unsupported-server guidance in the demo.

This run has no artifacts.
- **Durable artifacts:**
  - Local deployable WAR identity: `demo/target/cargo-tracker.war`, 8,232,335 bytes, SHA-256 `93b8fc97ab3b8afcd44b1a062cbada335af79f5a764865a2e1fe2ed47e0c5419`. This was produced and deployed locally; it is not represented as a hosted workflow artifact.
  - Supporting configuration/source: `demo/pom.xml`, `demo/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`, `demo/src/test/resources/arquillian.xml`, and `demo/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/booking/socket/RealtimeCargoTrackingService.java`.
  - Hosted CI evidence: implementation push run #29 / ID `36754101720` on commit `bc6c3e387ccf5b3cab5e14b5ab4d91d512ef426b`, with successful `formatting` job/check ID `110022167006` and `build` job/check ID `110022310098`; current evidence update push run #31 / ID `36754242738` on commit `bb9a8f033ac14935a235cd0710aed95efd1014d0`, with successful `formatting` job/check ID `110022156492` and `build` job/check ID `110022342235`. Both runs have no artifacts.
- **Evidence assessment:** Strong for hosted formatting/build and local unit/integration/runtime lifecycle. The hosted workflow verifies formatting and Maven build; the production HTTP readiness assertion and guaranteed Liberty shutdown were verified locally, not by hosted acceptance CI.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** Keep the `openliberty` profile excludable while canonical fast tiers use `-P!openliberty`; flattening the plugin into the main build would change those commands.

### Issue #4: Enforce the Java 17 and Java EE 7 compatibility contract

- **PR:** #12
- **Implementation commit:** `a3bee8d24ec54e6b3587ccf0cec443969d0609bd` (validated implementation HEAD)
- **Completed:** 2026-10-01 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 1, 3, 5
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 1, 3, 5
- **Implementation result:** Added focused POM, Liberty, and production-source assertions; isolated negative fixtures; repository agent instructions; and a single deployed Open Liberty acceptance lifecycle with bounded evidence.
- **Observed events:**
  - Local compatibility validation passed for compiler release 17, `javax:javaee-api:7.0` in provided scope, WAR packaging/final name, `javaee-7.0`, WAR location, and `/cargo-tracker`.
  - Negative fixtures rejected a Jakarta import, Jakarta dependency, release 21, JAR packaging, renamed WAR, Spring dependency, and removed `javaee-7.0`, each naming the violated boundary.
  - The packaged WAR deployed and returned seeded `ABC123` from `/cargo-tracker/rest/cargo`; the acceptance script captured deploy/start/readiness/stop evidence and stopped Liberty cleanly.
  - Hosted Main Build run [#36801557821](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36801557821) passed on validated implementation HEAD `a3bee8d24ec54e6b3587ccf0cec443969d0609bd`; `formatting` job/check [110176804872](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36801557821/job/110176804872) and `build` job/check [110176909417](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36801557821/job/110176909417) both succeeded.
  - Direct Jakarta and Spring dependencies were rejected from the project-level dependency list, and compatibility metadata passed required-field, file-size, and SHA-256 verification.

- **Evidence assessment:** Strong for the validated implementation HEAD hosted contract, negative controls, artifact evidence, and deployed runtime lifecycle.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** Keep repository assertions narrow and let the packaged WAR, rather than a managed test-only deployment, define the Open Liberty acceptance boundary.

### Issue #5: Strengthen formatting, compiler, type, and static-analysis gates

- **PR:** #13
- **Implementation commit:** `64e2cbd`
- **Completed:** 2026-10-01 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 1, 4, 6
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 1, 4, 6
- **Implementation result:** Preserved the Spotless ratchet, enabled `-Xlint:all -Werror` for main and test compilation, fixed the 14 compiler warnings, and added the focused SpotBugs 4.10.4 gate with a 90-day `source-gates` artifact.
- **Observed events:**
  - Local formatting passed after applying the historical ratchet; the malformed formatting fixture failed with Spotless's `spotless:apply` remediation.
  - Main and test compilation passed independently with Java 17 and `-Werror`; the invented API fixture failed with a file/line `cannot find symbol` diagnostic. Hosted `source-gates` job/check [110185685393](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/job/110185685393) passed on tested SHA `b19c8c9f2a67822ff5c3abc4a7de888dee353e79`.
  - SpotBugs passed with zero selected production findings after fixing five shared `SimpleDateFormat` hazards, the permanently null booking result, and the unwritten route field. The null-dereference fixture failed as priority 1 `NP_ALWAYS_NULL` with a source line.
  - Source-gate commands disabled the active Open Liberty profile and did not run deployment, readiness, or acceptance lifecycle steps. The successful hosted `formatting`, `source-gates`, and `build` jobs were independently attributable: [formatting 110185574947](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/job/110185574947), [source-gates 110185685393](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/job/110185685393), and [build 110186078979](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36804048610/job/110186078979), all on tested SHA `b19c8c9f2a67822ff5c3abc4a7de888dee353e79`.

   - **Evidence assessment:** Strong for hosted formatting, compiler, test-compiler, SpotBugs, and controlled-failure evidence on tested SHA `b19c8c9f2a67822ff5c3abc4a7de888dee353e79`; the local transcript demonstrates the same mechanisms independently.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** Keep the compiler and analyzer source gates profile-excluded so they cannot repeat the Open Liberty acceptance lifecycle; keep future SpotBugs suppressions class-and-pattern-specific.

### Issue #7: Add CI observability and diagnostic artifacts

- **PR:** #16
- **Implementation commit:** `87d6768d9eed2a29efee6357107f383a00c0ab5e`
- **Completed:** 2026-10-01 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 8
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 8
- **Implementation result:** Added pinned local OpenTelemetry Java-agent and Collector instrumentation to the existing bounded Liberty acceptance lifecycle, with correlated trace/metric exports, artifact redaction gates, and immutable diagnostic artifacts.
- **Observed events:**
  - Main Build run [36839380274](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36839380274) succeeded on final reviewed SHA `87d6768d9eed2a29efee6357107f383a00c0ab5e`; the `build` job [110295058827](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36839380274/job/110295058827) completed observability acceptance and all negative controls.
  - Both fixed-ID requests were correlated across `request-transcript.jsonl`, server spans in `traces.json`, and `observability-access.log`; `metrics.json` contained nonempty JVM/runtime metrics.
  - Negative controls explicitly rejected collector unavailability, incompatible instrumentation, missing telemetry, broken correlation, an unsafe query-bearing exemplar with seeded cargo data, secret-like artifact content, and an invalid request without a diagnostic signal. The final artifact scan passed before metadata and artifact upload.
  - The workflow uploaded `otel-telemetry` and `liberty-logs` as separate immutable artifacts with schema-1 metadata and inventories.
- **Durable artifacts:**
  - Successful Main Build run [36839380274](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36839380274), final reviewed SHA `87d6768d9eed2a29efee6357107f383a00c0ab5e`, `build` job [110295058827](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36839380274/job/110295058827).

  - The uploaded `compatibility-contract` artifact from the same run contains `demo/ci-artifacts/compatibility-contract/observability-negative-controls.txt`.
  - Implementation sources: `demo/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`, `demo/scripts/ci/verify-observability.py`, `demo/scripts/ci/redact-artifacts.sh`, `demo/scripts/ci/run-observability-check.sh`, and `demo/scripts/ci/run-observability-negative-controls.sh`.
- **Evidence assessment:** Strong: exact-SHA hosted CI passed the full relevant lifecycle and diagnostics, checked final redaction, and published artifacts with recorded IDs and digests. This demonstrates the configured diagnostic path and its exercised failure controls, not external telemetry services or production-wide observability.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** Keep telemetry local and artifact-bound; correlate requests with fixed IDs across transcript, spans, and filtered runtime logs, and enforce redaction at both Collector and final-upload boundaries.

### Issue #8: Add bounded JVM performance and `jaz` evidence

- **PR:** #17
- **Implementation HEAD:** `3e141c26cfbd6e5469aeebd2b627b620b28ab725` (validated pre-merge PR head)
- **Hosted PR merge-test SHA:** `8ce8b6e0bfaaa8c40d5951ffd7e1c7d5d867bd14` (artifact metadata; distinct from the implementation HEAD)
- **Completed:** 2026-10-01 UTC
- **Reasons expected to be exercised:** 9
- **Reasons actually exercised:** 8 (additional JVM/process diagnostics) and 9
- **Implementation result:** Added the shared non-containerized workload and performed the five-cycle direct Java, bypassed `jaz`, and tuned `jaz` comparison with JVM/process/JFR/GC diagnostics and immutable evidence artifacts. Hosted measurements are diagnostic evidence, not a performance ranking.
- **Observed events:**
  - Successful Main Build run [36918453972](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36918453972), attempt 1, tested implementation HEAD `3e141c26cfbd6e5469aeebd2b627b620b28ab725`. The PR merge-test SHA in artifact metadata is `8ce8b6e0bfaaa8c40d5951ffd7e1c7d5d867bd14`; it is not the implementation HEAD.
  - The `formatting` job [110558201739](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36918453972/job/110558201739), `source-gates` job [110558380614](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36918453972/job/110558380614), and `build` job [110558962626](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/actions/runs/36918453972/job/110558962626) succeeded. The build ran all 15 repetitions, verified every retained JFR, generated checksummed metadata, passed final performance redaction, and uploaded all four performance artifacts.
  - `performance-comparison/status.txt` reports all 15 launcher-mode repetitions passed functional, diagnostic, resource, and cleanup gates; `run-order.tsv` records the complete required five-cycle order. `mode-summary.tsv` and `paired-comparison.tsv` preserve descriptive results; no winner is selected from hosted-runner variation.
  - Supporting per-mode evidence includes `artifact-metadata.json`, per-run GC logs, JFR summaries, selected JVM flags, and, for tuned `jaz`, the `JAZ_DRY_RUN=1` output. The logs verify launcher modes, workload equivalence, JVM diagnostics, and cleanup.
  - Stage 40 Copilot review identified that the JFC transformation changed an event attribute instead of its child `enabled` setting. The correction unconditionally disables all five sensitive event types and requires a zero-count check on every recording before upload; see [review thread](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4158179007).
  - A follow-up review found that resource sampling began only after readiness. The correction distinguishes Liberty status helpers from the server JVM and samples the unique server PID during startup while retaining strict identity checks; see [review thread](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4158414950).
  - The next review found that artifact metadata was generated after the upload redaction boundary and that post-run gate failures retained a zero exit status. Upload now requires a final scan of the complete artifact directories, and summaries set `exitStatus` to `1` when post-run gates fail; see [review thread](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4158623918).
  - A further review found that failed runs could retain unverified recordings and identified related measurement-integrity gaps. The workflow now rejects any retained JFR with sensitive events; summaries select the server-PID GC log; direct/bypass initial and maximum heap evidence is required and compared; compiler-count tuning is rejected; each repetition has a cleanup-reserving watchdog; and immutable inputs are rehashed before every launch. See [review thread](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4158922639).
  - The subsequent zero-finding review surfaced two missed no-user-tuning cases. The harness now also rejects `-Xint`, `-Xcomp`, and tuning inside quoted `server.env` assignments before launch; see [review](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#pullrequestreview-5384007681).
  - The final implementation review expanded compiler-override rejection and found persistent Derby state outside the Liberty server snapshot. The validated harness rejects batch/tiered/background/threshold compiler controls, restores and hashes an empty database baseline before every launch, and preserves any pre-existing local database; see [review thread](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4159467149).
  - The final remediation rejects active Liberty before touching Derby state and rejects String Deduplication from every JVM option source; see [database preflight](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4159867795) and [tuning](https://github.com/edburns/dd-3016202-cargotracker-devoxx-be-2026/pull/17#discussion_r4159867871) review threads.

  - Implementation and workload contract: `demo/performance/README.md` and `demo/performance/`.
- **Evidence assessment:** Strong for the bounded hosted comparison, functional equivalence, diagnostics, resource envelope, and cleanup across all 15 launches, with immutable artifacts and checksummed inventories. It supports launcher integration and descriptive measurement only; it does not establish a performance winner or AKS-limit behavior.
- **Candidate reusable lessons:** Treat hosted JVM measurements as diagnostic evidence; retain per-run workload and launch metadata, and do not rank modes based on noisy runner measurements.

### Fixture baseline repair: extensible `BookingServiceTest` CI gate

- **Implementation commit:** `94950cfceefc85edaec68eb6b61a16e0e6779ecc`
- **Completed:** 2026-10-02 UTC
- **Reason exercised:** 2
- **Implementation result:** Replaced the exact `BookingServiceTest` count of
  four with a contract that requires the historical four named methods,
  requires zero failures, errors, and skipped tests, and permits additional
  valid tests.
- **Observed events:**
  - The exact local Open Liberty integration tier passed four tests with zero
    failures, errors, or skipped tests.
  - The revised assertion passed the real four-test Surefire report.
  - A derived five-test report containing `testChangeDeadline` passed the same
    assertion, proving the gate no longer rejects the fixture's required fifth
    test merely because the suite grew.
  - Hosted Main Build passed formatting, source gates, the full build and
    acceptance pipeline, and artifact publication on the exact implementation
    SHA.

- **Evidence assessment:** Strong exact-SHA hosted evidence plus direct local
  proof that both the feature-free four-test suite and the planned five-test
  suite satisfy the repaired contract.
- **Candidate reusable lesson:** Prefer named required tests and
  zero-failure/error/skip invariants over a brittle exact suite cardinality
  when a planned feature intentionally adds tests.

## Appendix I: Human observations

- While filling out the ignorance reduction plan, I was frequently guided toward narrowing the possible paths the agents could go. See "1.6 — Executable Java 17 and Java EE 7 compatibility contract". Without narrowing it down, the agents might want to upgrade the system forward: javax → jakarta for example. By explicitly disallowing that, we close down that possible wandering path.
